This document updates RFC 6838 "Media Type Specifications and Registration
Procedures" to describe how to interpret subtypes with multiple suffixes.

    <t>
As written, RFC 6838 [RFC6838] permits the registration of media type subtype
names which contain any number of occurrences of the "+" character. RFC 6838
defines the characters following the final "+" to be a structured syntax
suffix, but does not define anything further about how to interpret subtype
names containing more than one "+" character.
    </t>
    <t>
This document updates RFC 6838 to clarify how to interpret subtype names
containing more than one "+" character as subtypes with multiple suffixes.
    </t>
    <t>
As registration of media types which use a structured suffix has become widely
supported, this enables further specialization of media types that build on
already registered and well-defined media types which themselves use a
structured suffix.
    </t>

    <section anchor="media-types-with-multiple-suffixes" title="Media Types with Multiple Suffixes">
      <t>
The following paragraphs are additions to RFC 6838.
      </t>
      <t>
Media types MAY be registered with more than one suffix appended to the base
subtype name. The suffixes MUST be interpreted as ordered, starting with the
most specific (the base subtype name) on the left, to the most generic on the
right. Characters before the first "+" in a subtype name specify the base
subtype name. Characters following each subsequent "+" in a subtype name
denote additional syntax specifier suffixes.
      </t>
      <t>
This means that receivers of the media type can do generic processing on the
underlying representation according to their ability to process any subset of
the right-most suffix(es) in cases where specific handling of the exact media
type is not required.
      </t>
      <t>
Media types with more than one suffix MUST be registered according to the
procedure defined in [RFC6838] with the additional requirement that each
subset of suffixes, starting from the right-most suffix, MUST be individually
registered as a subtype in its own right.
      </t>
      <t>
For example, a media type that uses the two suffixes "+svg+xml" is only
permitted insofar as "svg+xml" is already registered.
